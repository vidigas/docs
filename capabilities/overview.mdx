description: "10 capability verbs for AI agents"
---

Saturn exposes AI services as **capabilities** — abstract verbs that route to the best available provider. You call `saturn.reason()`, not `openai.chat.completions.create()`.

## Available Capabilities

| Capability | What the agent gets | Backed by |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| [`reason`](/capabilities/reason) | LLM inference — completions, summarization, extraction | OpenAI, Anthropic |
| [`search`](/capabilities/search) | Web search — query to ranked results | Serper, Brave |
| [`read`](/capabilities/read) | URL to clean text — articles, docs, pages | Jina, Firecrawl |
| [`scrape`](/capabilities/scrape) | URL to structured HTML — raw extraction | Firecrawl, ScraperAPI |
| [`execute`](/capabilities/execute) | Sandboxed code execution — Python, JS, shell | E2B |
| [`imagine`](/capabilities/imagine) | Text to image generation | Replicate |
| [`speak`](/capabilities/speak) | Text to speech | ElevenLabs |
| [`transcribe`](/capabilities/transcribe) | Speech to text | Deepgram |
| [`email`](/capabilities/email) | Transactional email | Resend |
| [`sms`](/capabilities/sms) | SMS messages | Twilio |

## Why Capabilities?

### Provider Abstraction

You don't care which search provider is fastest today. You care about getting search results.

```typescript
// You call this:
const results = await saturn.search({ query: 'AI news' });

// Saturn routes to Serper, Brave, or the next best option
// You get results in a consistent format
```

### Unified Billing

Every capability call goes through the same billing pipeline:

1. Quote the cost
2. Check against budget
3. Execute
4. Deduct credits
5. Return receipt

One bill. One audit trail. Regardless of provider.

### Automatic Failover

If a provider is down, Saturn routes to the next available option. Your agent keeps working.

## Response Format

Every capability returns the same structure:

```typescript
interface CapabilityResponse<T> {
  data: T;              // Capability-specific result
  metadata: {
    chargedSats: number;      // Actual cost (sats)
    chargedUsdCents: number;  // Actual cost (USD)
    quotedSats: number;       // Pre-quoted estimate
    balanceAfter: number;     // Remaining credits
    auditId: string;          // Unique receipt ID
    provider: string;         // Which provider handled it
    latencyMs: number;        // Request duration
  };
}
```

## Listing Capabilities

```typescript
// Get all available capabilities
const capabilities = await saturn.capabilities.list();

// Get details for a specific capability
const reason = await saturn.capabilities.get('reason');
console.log(reason.providers); // ['openai', 'anthropic', ...]
console.log(reason.pricing);   // Pricing tiers
```

## Direct Service Access

For services not mapped to a capability, use the proxy:

```typescript
// Call any registered service directly
const result = await saturn.call<MyResponseType>('openai', {
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello' }],
});
```

This still goes through Saturn's billing and policy enforcement.
