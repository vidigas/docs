## Is Saturn a proxy?

Saturn is more than a proxy. A proxy forwards requests. Saturn:
- Authenticates per-agent identity
- Enforces spend limits before forwarding
- Manages credits and settlement
- Issues receipts with cost attribution
- Provides kill switches and policy controls

The request goes through Saturn, but Saturn is an enforcement layer, not a passthrough.

## Can I use my own provider keys?

**With hosted Saturn:** No. Saturn manages provider credentials. This is intentional:
- You don't handle key rotation for multiple providers
- Saturn negotiates rates and handles billing
- Unified audit trail across providers

**With self-hosted Saturn:** Yes. You configure your own provider credentials. You also handle your own payment processing and rate management.

## Does Saturn add latency?

Saturn adds minimal latency:
- Policy checks: < 5ms
- Credit checks: < 5ms
- Total overhead: typically < 20ms

For LLM calls that take 500ms–5000ms, Saturn overhead is negligible.

## Can I do per-user budgets?

Yes. Create one agent per user:

```typescript
// When user signs up
const { apiKey } = await saturn.agents.create({
  name: `user-${userId}`,
  maxPerDayUsdCents: 100, // $1/day per user
});

// Store apiKey associated with user
// Use that key for all calls on behalf of that user
```

This gives you:
- Per-user isolation
- Per-user spend limits
- Per-user audit trail

## How do I reconcile monthly spend?

1. **Dashboard**: View aggregate and per-agent spend
2. **API**: Query transactions and audit logs
3. **Receipts**: Store audit IDs and sum `chargedUsdCents`

```typescript
// Example: sum spend for an agent this month
const logs = await saturn.admin.auditLogs({
  agentId,
  startDate: startOfMonth,
  endDate: now,
});
const totalCents = logs.reduce((sum, log) => sum + log.chargedUsdCents, 0);
```

Saturn credits = your spend. Provider reconciliation is Saturn's responsibility.

## What happens when credits run out?

Calls are rejected with `CREDIT_EXHAUSTED`. No call is made to upstream providers. Your agents stop making paid calls until you add credits.

This is intentional. Prepaid means prepaid.

## Can agents share a budget?

Not directly. Each agent has its own policy. However:
- All agents draw from the account's credit pool
- You can set similar caps across agents
- Account-level balance is shared; agent-level caps are not

For true shared budgets, use a single agent for multiple workloads (not recommended for isolation reasons).

## What providers are supported?

Saturn currently supports:

| Capability | Providers |
|------------|-----------|

More providers are added regularly.

## Can I request a new provider?

Yes. Submit a request via the registry:

```bash
POST /v1/registry/submit
```

Or contact us directly. Provider requirements are documented in our [Provider Eligibility](/provider-eligibility) guide.

## Is there an SLA?

Contact us for enterprise SLA agreements.

## How secure is Saturn?

- All traffic is encrypted (TLS)
- API keys are hashed (bcrypt)
- No provider credentials in your runtime
- Per-agent isolation
- Full audit trail
- SOC 2 compliance (in progress)

See our [Security](/security) documentation for details.

## Can I self-host Saturn?

Yes. Saturn is available for self-hosting. You configure your own:
- Provider credentials
- Payment processing (LND for Lightning)
- Database (PostgreSQL)

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/saturn-pay/saturn) for deployment instructions.
